# Now that you have run your benchmarks, which algorithm runs faster?
# The Greedy Transport Algorithm [X]
# The Brute Force Transport Algorithm
# They take the same amount of time

# Consider the properties of the GREEDY algorithm. Will it return the optimal 
# solution?
# Yes, all the time
# No, never
# It could, but it depends on the data, not always. [X]

# Consider the properties of the BRUTE FORCE algorithm. Will it return 
# the optimal solution?
# Yes, all the time [X]
# No, never
# It could, but it depends on the data, not always.

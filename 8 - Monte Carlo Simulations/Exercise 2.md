## Exercise 2

If you wanted to run a simulation that estimates the value of sqrt(2) in a way similar to the Pi estimation shown in lecture, what geometric shape would you throw needles at?

- A square, with a smaller square drawn inside it. The smaller square is formed by connecting the larger square's midpoints.
- A cube with a sphere inscribed inside it.
- A flat line ranging from 1 to root 2 and with a subsection that spans from 0 to 1. [X

What introduced the error for Archimedes' method of calculating Pi?

- Incorrect conceptual model. [X]
- Calculation error.
- Not enough samples.

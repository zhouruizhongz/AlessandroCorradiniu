Dynamic programming can be used to solve optimization problems where the size of the space of possible solutions is exponentially large.

- True [X]
- False

Dynamic programming can be used to find an approximate solution to an optimization problem, but cannot be used to find a solution that is guaranteed to be optimal.

- True
- False [X]

Recall that sorting a list of integers can take  using an algorithm like merge sort. Dynamic programming can be used to reduce the order of algorithmic complexity of sorting a list of integers to something below , where n is the length of the list to be sorted.

True
False [X]

Problem: I need to go up a flight of  stairs. I can either go up 1 or 2 steps every time. How many different ways are there for me to traverse these steps? For example:

```
3 steps -> could be 1,1,1 or 1,2 or 2,1
4 steps -> could be 1,1,1,1 or 1,1,2 or 1,2,1 or 2,1,1 or 2,2
5 steps -> could be 1,1,1,1,1 or 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,2,1 or 1,2,1,1 or 2,1,1,1 or 2,2,1 or 1,2,2 or 2,1,2
```

Does this problem have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems?

- It has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems [X]
- It doe not have optimal substructure and does not have overlapping subproblems
- It has optimal substructure and does not have overlapping subproblems
- It does not have optimal substructure and it has overlapping subproblems

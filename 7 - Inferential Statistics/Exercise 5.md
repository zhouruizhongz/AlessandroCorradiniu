## Exercise 5

In the lecture, you saw a uniform and a normal distribution. There is another type of distribution, called an exponential distribution. For the following real-life situations, fill in the blank with the appropriate distribution model (normal, uniform, or exponential) that would best simulate the situation.

- Rolling a fair 6-sided die. Uniform
- Sum of rolling 2 fair 6-sided dice. Normal
- Women's shoe sizes. Normal
- Human intelligence (IQ) scores. Normal
- Amount of mold on bread, assuming an infinite supply of bread. Exponential
- The winning lottery numbers. Uniform
- Skilled person throwing darts at a dart board. Normal
- Radioactive decay (time between successive atom decays). Exponential

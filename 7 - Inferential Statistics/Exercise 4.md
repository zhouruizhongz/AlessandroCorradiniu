## Exercise 4

The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Loosely, it's a measure of how variable the population is in relation to the mean.

1. Figure 1 shows the skyline of Pythonland, and Figure 2 shows the skyline of Montyland.

Considering the heights of buildings in Pythonland and Montyland, which has a larger coefficient of variation?

- Pythonland
- Montyland [X]

2. Which of the following populations has the highest coefficient of variation?


- [1, 2, 3] [X]
- [11, 12, 13]
- [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

3. Compute the coefficient of variation of [10, 4, 12, 15, 20, 5] to 3 decimal places.

## Exercise 7

In this problem, we're going to calculate some various probabilities.

You pick three balls in succession out of a bucket of 3 red balls and 3 green balls. Assume replacement after picking out each ball. What is the probability of each of the following events?

1. Three red balls: A : {R,R,R}. Answer in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

1/8
 
2. The sequence red, green, red: A : {R,G,R}. Answer in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

1/8
 
3. Any sequence with 2 reds and 1 green. Answer in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

3/8

4. Any sequence where the number of reds is greater than or equal to the number of greens. Answer in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

1/2
 
5. You have a bucket with 3 red balls and 3 green balls. This time, assume you don't replace the ball after taking it out. What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color? Answer in reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

1/10

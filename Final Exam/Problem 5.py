# K-means is a greedy algorithm, meaning it looks for local minimum when choosing 
# points closest to the centroid. For each dataset illustrated below, will k-means, 
# as shown in lecture, using Euclidean distance as the metric be able to find clusters 
# that match the dataset patterns?

# Dataset 1 - No
# Dataset 2 - Yes
# Dataset 3 - No
# Dataset 4 - No
# Dataset 5 - Yes
# Dataset 6 - No

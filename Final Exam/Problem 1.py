# Problem 1-1
# Consider deriving the probability of a coin flip coming up heads by running m trials of 100 
# flips each. If the coin is fair, the mean probability of the m trials will go to 0.5 as m 
# goes to infinity.

# True [X]
# False

# Problem 1-2
# Consider two normal distributions, A and B. The standard deviation of A is 3 and the standard 
# deviation of B is 5. For each distribution, 1,000 observations are drawn and plotted in a 
# histogram with 10 bins, creating one histogram for each distribution.

# The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B. 
# The rightmost bin of B will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of A.
# The rightmost bin of A will have the same number of points as the rightmost bin of B.
# Any of the above are possible.
 
# Problem 1-3
# You roll an unfair (weighted) die. The distribution of the numbers rolled is a uniform distribution.

# True
# False [X]

# Problem 1-4
# A simulation

# is useful when describing a system that cannot easily be described mathematically.
# is easy to successively refine.
# can be used to extract intermediate results.
# All of the above [X]
# None of the above

# Problem 1-5
# The following image plots the population of the US over time, along with a model fit to the data. 
# This is an example ofpoints linearly from 1900 to 2000 and a red line fitted to the points 
# that dips to 0 from x=2000 to x=2050 

# overfitting [X]
# underfitting
# Neither of the above

# Problem 1-6
# If the  of a model produced using linear regression is 0.7, the model accounts for 70% of the 
# variance in the observations.

# True [X]
# False

# Problem 1-7
# Given a finite set of data points there exists a polynomial fit such that the polynomial curve 
# goes through each point in the data.

# True
# False [X]

# Problem 1-8
# You want to calculate confidence intervals by applying the empirical rule, which requires that 
# you have a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. Which approach 
# can you use to estimate the mean and standard deviation that you need? Choose all that work.

# - Central Limit Theorem, which requires that you have many sufficiently large samples from the 
#   population [X]
# - Standard Error, which requires that you have one sufficiently large sample [X]

# Problem 1-9
# You have a bucket with 4 red balls and 4 green balls. You draw 3 balls out of the bucket. 
# Assume that once you draw a ball out of the bucket, you don't replace it. 
# What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color? Answer the question in 
# reduced fraction form - eg 1/5 instead of 2/10.

# 1/7
